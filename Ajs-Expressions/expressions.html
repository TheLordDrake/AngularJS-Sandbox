<!--
    AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

    AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive: ng-bind="expression".

    AngularJS will resolve the expression, and return the result exactly where the expression is written.

    AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions: They can contain literals, operators, and variables.

    Example {{ 5 + 5 }} or {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}

    -----

    AngularJS Expressions vs. JavaScript Expressions
    Like JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can contain literals, operators, and variables.

    Unlike JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can be written inside HTML.

    AngularJS expressions do not support conditionals, loops, and exceptions, while JavaScript expressions do.

    AngularJS expressions support filters, while JavaScript expressions do not.

        AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

        The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

    <div>
        <!-- Angular JS expressions are written inside double braces. -->
        <p>My first expression in angular is {{ 5 + 5 }}</p>
    </div>
    
    <div ng-init="myCol='lightblue'">
        <input style="background-color:{{myCol}}" ng-model="myCol">
    </div>

    <!-- Angular works with numerics the same way JS does -->
    <div ng-init="quantity = 1; cost = 5">
        <p>Total in dollars: {{ quantity * cost }}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Using ng-bind -->
    <div ng-init="quantity = 1; cost = 5">
        <p>Total in dollars: <span ng-bind="quantity * cost"></span></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Using strings is the same as JS -->
    <div ng-init="firstName = 'John'; lastName = 'Doe'">
        <p>The name is {{ firstName + ' ' + lastName }}</p>
        <p>The name is <span ng-bind="firstName + ' ' + lastName"></span></p>
    </div>

    Using Objects:
    <div ng-init="person={firstName:'John', lastName:'Doe'}">
        <p>Thename is {{ person.lastName }}</p>
        <p>The name is <span ng-bind="person.lastName"></span></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Angular arrays are just like JS arrays -->
    <div ng-init="points=[1, 15, 19, 2, 40]">
        <p>The third result is {{ points[2] }}</p>
        <p>The third result is <span ng-bind="points[2]"></span></p>
    </div>
